                On 15th June, 2017 Bangladesh face a familiar opposition. An opposition that knows the strengths and weaknesses of Bangladesh fully and an adversary that is stronger in every cricketing department compared to the Tigers. With the batting firepower, bowling variety and track record in ICC tournament, no rational cricket fan would dare to write-off India as the tournament favorites and potential champions. So the big question is what must the Tigers do to try and beat India in the upcoming semi-final game? Iftekhar Khan highlights six vital areas that could change the outcome in favor of Bangladesh as the underdogs.(Iftekhar Khan)
